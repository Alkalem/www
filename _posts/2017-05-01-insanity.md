DEF CON Quals were this weekend, and as always, they delivered some of the
hardest pwning challenges we've seen this year. *insanity* was not even one of them,
but we still spent several hours solving it, and had tons of fun.
The concept is a classic: The program implements a custom VM with weird operations,
and you have to reverse and exploit it...

There *is* a slight twist though: *insanity* accepts its input as 4-second "voice
commands", encoded as a 16 kHz, 8-bit audio file. Here's the *jump* command for
your listening pleasure:

<audio controls>
  <source src="/files/defconquals17/short_8.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

But let's cut to it.  The program uses the
[PocketSphinx](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/sphinx/doc/doxygen/pocketsphinx/pocketsphinx_8h.html)
library for speech recognition. Here is the code of the main function:

So, how does it work?

The program reads a series of data chunks from the user, each prefixed by their
length (packed as a little-endian DWORD) and each at most 0x10000 bytes long.
It decompresses every chunk using zlib (the result has to be at most 0x10000 bytes
too) and XORs every byte with 0x80. The result is a sequence of 8-bit audio samples,
which has to be recorded at 16 kHz, so this represents an approximately 4 second
audio file.
The samples get expanded to 16 bits by multiplying the values with 0x100.

Each 4 second chunk of audio is then individually passed to the PocketSphinx library
for recognition. The program assumes that the recognized string has the
form `"insanity "*X + "insane"` for some integer X. The value X is then
appended to the VM memory and will later be interpreted as a VM instruction.

If recognition succeeds (as in, returns *some* hypothesis string), but does not
yield a string of the correct format, the program simply continues to read
chunks. This means that if we send a fake chunk with non-audio data and then
end with 4 zero bytes, we control the contents of the `samples_8bit` buffer
completely. This behaviour will turn out to be useful in the actual exploit.

Pretty insane so far?
Yeah we though so too.


## Generating the numbers 1 to 8

We tried several methods of generating the audio files, and ended up with
something that works at least up the value 8, which was enough for our
purposes:

1. Use the macOS speech synthesizer to create the sentence: `say -v samantha -o sound.aiff insanity insanity ... insane`
1. Convert to 16-bit, 16 kHz WAV using ffmpeg: `ffmpeg -i sound.aiff -ar 16000 sound.wav`
1. For values 6 and above, do manual post-processing to bring the length of the
   file down. We used *audacity* to cut off some silence in the beginning and
   end of the file, truncate the last word a bit and increase the tempo by ~35%.
1. Read the 16-bit samples from the audio file and convert them to 8-bit using
   rounding.
1. XOR every sample with 0x80.

Here is Python code that automates the last two steps:

{% highlight python %}
sound_files = [None]
sound_files += ['%s/raw_%d.wav' % (sounds_dir, i) for i in range(1,6)]
sound_files += ['%s/short_%d.wav' % (sounds_dir, i) for i in range(6,9)]

def get_sound(num):
    samples = 0
    block = []
    with open(sound_files[num]) as f:
        f.read(0xe0) # consume header
        while True:
            lo = f.read(1)
            if not lo: break
            hi = f.read(1)
            # we pack the 16-bit word into one byte via rounding
            lo = ord(lo)
            hi = ord(hi)
            if lo > 0x100/2:
                hi+=1
            hi = min(hi,0xff)
            # somehow everything gets XOR'ed with 0x80
            block.append(chr(hi^0x80))
            samples+=1
    assert samples <= 0x10000
    return ''.join(block)
{% endhighlight %}

And here is some sample code that sends a series of VM commands:

{% highlight python %}
def pack_chunk(chunk):
    chunk = zlib.compress(chunk)
    return struct.pack('<I', len(chunk)) + chunk

code = [1, 3, 3, 7]

TARGET = ('<host>', port)
s = socket.create_connection(TARGET)
for c in code:
  s.sendall(pack_chunk(get_sound(c)))
s.sendall(struct.pack('<I', 0))   # end packet
{% endhighlight %}
