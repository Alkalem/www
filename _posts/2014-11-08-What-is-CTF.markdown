CTF stands for captcha the flag. It's a contest in wich you can test your infosec, hacking, crypto, logic or w/e skills. You could registrate as single person or as a team.

There're organized in some groups like:

### powning
Search for a bug and exploit it. Most the time to get shell and read the flag oder flag.txt file.

### reversing
You get a pice of code, or encrypted file and have to find out what it's doing or decrypt it.

### crypto
Just break the crypto. There could be a simple shuffler, caesar or something asymetric like RSA or DH key exchange...

### recon
These challs are different than the others. You have to search for hobbys, phone number or w/e of a person.

### forensic
You get a log or captchafile and have to find out what happend.
