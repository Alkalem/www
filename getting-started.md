Some Resources to get you started with CTF and infosec in general. Make sure to also check out our [resource collection](/resources).

## CTF in general

Probably the best resource to get started with CTF is the [Trail of Bits guide to CTF](https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/), but there is also the following [blog post on how to get started with CTF](http://www.endgame.com/blog/how-to-get-started-in-ctf.html).

Other than that you'll usually learn a lot from writeups for CTF challenges (especially for ones you tried but couldn't solve). A writeup is just a guide walking you through the solution for a challenge. There is a [CTF writeup repository on github](https://github.com/ctfs/write-ups) that contains a lot of them. You'll also find writeups for the corresponding CTFs on [ctftime.org](https://ctftime.org/).

If you want to practice a bit you can always take a look at [previous CTF challenges here](http://repo.shell-storm.org/CTF/) or the [over the wire wargames](http://overthewire.org/wargames/), but first check out the following section.

## How to get started in...

### Binary Exploitation

Personally I can strongly recommend the book ["Hacking - The Art of Exploitation"](http://www.nostarch.com/hacking2.htm).
There is also the following (huge) tutorial on exploitaion: [A Journey into Exploitation](http://myne-us.blogspot.de/2010/08/from-0x90-to-0x4c454554-journey-into.html).

For a nice overview over memory corruption bugs and exploitation see this whitepaper: [History of Memory Corruption Attacks (pdf)](https://media.blackhat.com/bh-us-10/whitepapers/Meer/BlackHat-USA-2010-Meer-History-of-Memory-Corruption-Attacks-wp.pdf).

To develop some more practical skills you can take a look at the [microcorruption](https://microcorruption.com) game. It is a browser based exploitation course guiding you through memory corruption exploitation on an embedded platform. It's designed for beginners but you will need to read up on the topics on your own.

### Cryptography

The [cryptopals](http://cryptopals.com/) challenges are a nice set of excercises that guide you through modern cryptography and how to break it. You'll also be doing quite a lot of programming throughout the course.

### Web Security

The [Web Application Hackers Handbook](http://mdsec.net/wahh/) is basically the bible of web security. If you don't mind reading a couple 100 pages you'll learn a lot from that book.

You can also take a look at the following online challenges/courses for learning some web security:
- [Web Wargames](http://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/)
- [SQLi Challenges](http://www.zixem.altervista.org/SQLi/)
- [XSS Game](https://xss-game.appspot.com/)

There is also the [Open Web Application Security Project](https://www.owasp.org) which also has some nice resources on web security.
