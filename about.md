We are a group of students from [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](http://www.kit.edu/english) interested in computer security and [CTF](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/).

We are currently participating under the name {{ site.teamname }}.

If you are a KIT student and interested in joining us, see [here](/we-want-you).
